React Native Environment Setup
===

The development target OS is **macOS**, and both of *Android* and *iOS* will instruct below.

## iOS
### Installing Dependencies

Node, Watchman, the React Native CLI, and Xcode are required.

**Node, Watchman**

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): version 8.11.1(LTS) is available now
2. [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/): is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

Both of then, you can install by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Xcode**

The easist way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
Installing Xcode will also *install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools* to build your iOS app.
**Make sure it is version 8 or higher.**

**Command Line Tools**

1. Open Xcode.
2. Choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. 
3. Switch to "Location" tab.
